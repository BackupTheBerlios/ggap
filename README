GGAP is a frontend for GAP computer algebra system (http://www.gap-system.org).

GGAP provides:
GAP-friendly text editor.
GAP-friendly terminal emulator.
Shared package which enables creating gui in GAP, somewhat similar to XGAP.

It works on Linux, Windows 2000/XP, FreeBSD, and hopefully on other
GTK-supported platforms.

For installation instructions see INSTALL file in the source directory.

Feature requests/comments/bug reports/questions are highly appreciated. You
can write to muntyan at tamu.edu and/or use bug tracking system at
http://sourceforge.net/projects/ggap . Also you can find me in #ggap
irc channel at irc.freenode.net.

See GGAP home page http://ggap.sourceforge.net for latest release.
